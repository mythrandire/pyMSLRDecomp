# Multi-scale Low-Rank Decomposition in Python

This project contains Python code to run multi-scale + low-rank matrix decomposition as introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08751). The code in this repository is a port of the MATLAB implementation [from the paper author(s)](https://github.com/frankong/multi_scale_low_rank/tree/master/matlab).

## Dependencies
At the time of writing, this code requires the following dependencies. (The code may or may not run with less or more recent versions.)

1. ```Python 3.6```
2. ```Numpy 1.18.1```
3. ```Matplotlib 3.1.2```
4. ```skimage 0.16.2```
5. ```opencv-python 4.2.0```

## About this Project

Although this Python code took hours of effort to complete, primary credit belongs with the author(s) of the original ```MATLAB``` code. This work was partially motivated by my course project for ***ELEN E6876:** Sparse and Low Rank Models for High Dimensional Data*, at Columbia University in the spring of 2020. The course is taught by Prof. John Wright.
